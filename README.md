Welcome to my website!
I will add interesting things to this page when I find them. 
This project was initially an 'unblocked games for school' type thing and it still kinda is, but now its just an archive of thins I find interesting.
Main directory is an unfinished modification of https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraft, 
/singleplayer is https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraft-beta
/cookies is cookie clicker, 
/macaroni is WebGL Pasta at https://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_pasta.html
